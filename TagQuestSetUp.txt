How to Set Up TagQuest

1. Clone the Github TagQuest Repo. 
2. Download Eclipse Kepler 4.3.2 
3. Open Eclipse, and select cloned repo as the workspace. Check your preferences to make sure you are using Java 1.6 as your compiler.
4. If this has been properly, you should see a file structure on the left of the workspace. Scale it down, right click and choose refresh. This simply overwrites a very small metadata folder that causes you not to see all classâ€™s in the file.
5. You now need to set up the Light Weight Java Game Library, and Slick2D.
	a. For the Light Weight Java Game Library, download version 2.9.1
	b. For Slick2D, googling it should bring up a download link.
	c. Install instructions can be found for both online.
6. Run the MainDisplayHandler.

This should run TagQuest.
