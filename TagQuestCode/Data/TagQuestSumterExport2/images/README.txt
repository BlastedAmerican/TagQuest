# This directory contains an export of media files from an installation of
# Metadata Games, a metadata tagging system from Tiltfactor Laboratory.
# For more information, see http://tiltfactor.org/mg/
#
# The export process formats the tags stored in mg for each media file, and
# appends that formatted string to the XMP dc:description field as
# embedded metadata.
